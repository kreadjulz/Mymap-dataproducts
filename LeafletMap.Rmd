## Summary
Here is a world map showing the big cities and towns that I have visited and the ones I dream of visiting in the future. They are coloured based on the "I have been" for cities i have been to and "I dream of visiting" for those Iam yet to visit. Hover over the markers to see the names of the cities.

```{r setup, echo =FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
#creating my dataframe
label <- c("Kampala", "Nairobi", "Dubai", "Bangkok", "Phuket", "Qatar", "NewYork", "New Jesery", "Dallas", "Atlanta", "Seattle", "Florence", "Capetown", "London", "Nassau", "Maldives", "Paris")
col <- c(rep("green",11 ), rep("purple", 6))
lat <- c(0.205149, -1.459511,  25.243989,13.795193, 7.828115, 24.929406, 40.711635, 40.054622, 32.769009, 33.745201, 47.605980, 43.832699, -34.020348, 51.506759, 25.039072, 3.250788, 48.889107)
